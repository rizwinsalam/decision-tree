The script generates synthetic classification data using scikit-learn's make_classification function.

It trains a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.

The model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizing the data and model performance metrics.
